from service.complexService import ComplexService

'''
get_complexes is the main function being called in the Controller layer.
Everything else should be set to private eventually. It's public now to make testing a little easier.
Should stay that way, we only want one contact point with other layers of the API and this one.

Get's a little bit spaghetti in the process_complexes function, as that accesses the get top five function.
All it does is sort the array of dictionaries by score and return the top 1-5 indices.
